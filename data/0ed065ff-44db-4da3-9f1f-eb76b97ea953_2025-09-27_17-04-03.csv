It was formulated to address escalating communal tensions and the urgent demand for independence in British India. The plan aimed to provide a swift and peaceful transfer of power while minimizing unrest, following the failure of previous efforts like the Cabinet Mission Plan and the rise of communal violence.

### Key Provisions:
- **Partition of British India:** The plan proposed dividing British India into two independent dominions—India and Pakistan.
- **Partition of Provinces:** Punjab and Bengal's legislative assemblies would vote on whether to partition their provinces. If a simple majority favored partition, the provinces would be divided.
- **Referendums:** Referendums were to be held in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Sylhet to decide whether they would join India or Pakistan.
- **Sindh's Decision:** The Sindh Legislative Assembly would independently decide whether to join India or Pakistan.
- **Boundary Commissions:** Boundary commissions were established to demarcate the borders between India and Pakistan, especially in Punjab and Bengal.
- **Dominion Status:** Both India and Pakistan would become independent dominions with full autonomy and sovereignty, each with its own Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution.
- **Princely States:** Princely states were required to accede to either India or Pakistan, based on geographical contiguity and the wishes of their people, with no option for independence.
- **Interim Government:** An interim government, comprising Indian leaders from various political parties, would manage administrative responsibilities until independence.
- **Timeline:** The date for independence was set for August 15, 1947, to ensure a swift transfer of power.

### Significance:
The Mountbatten Plan was crucial in shaping the political landscape of South Asia, leading to the end of British rule and the creation of India and Pakistan as independent nations [1]​[2].
