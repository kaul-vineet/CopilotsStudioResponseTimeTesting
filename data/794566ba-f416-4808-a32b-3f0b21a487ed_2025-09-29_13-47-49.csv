2,How do I troubleshoot issues with MCP server integration in Cursor?,"To troubleshoot issues with MCP server integration in Cursor, follow these steps:

1. **Verify MCP Server Configuration in Cursor**:
   - Go to: File → Preferences → Cursor Settings → MCP.
   - Ensure the MCP server is added using the 'Add new global MCP server' button.
   - Check the JSON configuration file (e.g., `mcp.json`) for correct syntax and required fields.
   - Confirm that the 'Server name' and 'Server path' fields are correctly specified and match your server setup.

2. **Check Server Status in Cursor**:
   - Verify that the server appears in the MCP Servers list and is marked as 'active' or 'Server Running.'
   - If the server is not running, double-check the command, arguments, and environment variables in your configuration.

3. **Validate Server URL and Path**:
   - Ensure the 'Server URL' field is correctly entered (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/sse`) for servers using a URL.
   - Confirm the absolute path to your server script is accurate and accessible for servers using a file path.

4. **Review Integration with Other Tools (e.g., Claude)**:
   - Edit the relevant configuration file (e.g., `claude_develop_config.json`) and ensure all required fields are present.
   - Ensure `serverPath`, `args`, and environment variables such as `NODE_API_PORT`, `NODE_API_KEY`, and `MODEL_API_KEY` are correctly set.

5. **Common Challenges and Solutions**:
   - **Incorrect JSON Syntax**: Double-check for missing commas, brackets, or quotation marks.
   - **Wrong Server Path**: Ensure the path points to the correct server script and is accessible from your system.
   - **Missing Environment Variables**: Add any required environment variables in your configuration.
   - **Server Not Appearing in Cursor**: Re-add the server and restart Cursor if necessary.

6. **Confirm Server is Live**:
   - The Cursor interface should show the server as 'active' or 'Server Running' once properly configured.
   - If issues persist, review the configuration and ensure all steps above are followed.

Carefully review your MCP server configuration in Cursor, validate all paths and environment variables, and ensure the server status is active. Address any syntax errors or missing fields in your JSON files for successful integration.

3,What are the ethical considerations in AI deployment?,"Ethical AI deployment requires robust guardrails, clear escalation paths for human intervention, and a cautious, iterative approach to expanding agent capabilities. These practices help ensure safety, reliability, and accountability in real-world applications. Human intervention is critical for high-risk actions and when failure thresholds are exceeded, while guardrails such as input filtering and safety classification help prevent unintended or harmful actions. Start small, validate with real users, and expand responsibly to maintain ethical standards in AI deployment [1]​[2].

7,What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and how does it work?,"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is a core component in a client-server architecture designed for AI applications. It enables communication and tool integration between user-facing AI applications (Hosts), intermediary Clients, and the underlying Servers that connect to resources like local filesystems, databases, and web APIs.

- **Host Application**: Captures user input, maintains conversation history, and displays model replies.
- **MCP Client**: Acts as a bridge between the Host and the Server, managing requests and responses.
- **MCP Server**: Executes commands and provides access to resources based on the requests received from the Client. It can be started using a transport mechanism like stdio and can offer various tools such as web data scraping and querying relevant documents.

The server exhibits agentic behavior by invoking different tools based on the type of query. This integration is visible in the Cursor IDE, where the MCP server enables new tools for the Cursor Agent, allowing it to retrieve information from the web or vector databases depending on the user's query.

9,What are the main components of MCP architecture?,"The main components of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture include:

1. **Host**: The user-facing AI application that interacts with the user.
2. **Client**: Acts as an intermediary between the Host and the Server, handling communication and requests.
3. **Server**: Processes requests from Clients and connects to underlying resources such as local filesystems, databases, and web APIs.

The architecture flow starts from Host applications, which connect to their respective MCP Clients. Clients then communicate with MCP Servers, which access resources to fulfill requests. This modular and scalable architecture ensures efficient AI applications and tool integrations [1].

10,How can I run an agent to interact with a SQLite MCP server?,"To run an agent to interact with a SQLite MCP server, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Install necessary packages such as `sqlite3` and `fastmcp` using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install sqlite3 fastmcp
     ```

2. **Start the MCP Server**:
   - Create a Python script to initialize the MCP server with SQLite integration:
     ```python
     from fastmcp import MCPServer
     import sqlite3

     def setup_database():
         conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
         c = conn.cursor()
         c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, info TEXT)''')
         conn.commit()
         conn.close()

     setup_database()

     server = MCPServer()
     server.run()
     ```

3. **Run the Agent Loop**:
   - Create a Python script to handle user messages and interact with the SQLite MCP server:
     ```python
     import asyncio
     from fastmcp import MCPClient

     async def main():
         client = MCPClient()
         await client.connect('http://localhost:8000')

         while True:
             user_input = input(""Enter command: "")
             response = await client.send_command(user_input)
             print(""Response:"", response)

     asyncio.run(main())
     ```

4. **Process Commands**:
   - Use asynchronous functions to process commands and return responses from the SQLite database:
     ```python
     async def process_command(command):
         conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
         c = conn.cursor()
         if command.startswith(""add""):
             info = command.split("" "", 1)[1]
             c.execute(""INSERT INTO data (info) VALUES (?)"", (info,))
             conn.commit()
             return ""Data added successfully.""
         elif command.startswith(""fetch""):
             c.execute(""SELECT * FROM data"")
             rows = c.fetchall()
             return rows
         conn.close()
     ```

By following these steps, you can set up an agent to interact with a SQLite MCP server, allowing it to add or fetch data from the database and provide structured results.
