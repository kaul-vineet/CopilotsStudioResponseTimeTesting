57,What is artificial intelligence (AI)?,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems or agents that can reason through ambiguity, take action across tools, and handle multi-step tasks with a high degree of autonomy. Unlike simpler applications, AI agents are capable of executing workflows end-to-end, making them suitable for complex decisions, unstructured data, or brittle rule-based systems. AI agents can automate not just individual tasks but entire workflows, delivering intelligence and adaptability in business processes [1].

[1]: cite:1 ""Citation-1""",9.046831499988912,f6011423-adb0-4703-b90f-3c9d7aaa66c2,522
58,How does machine learning differ from traditional programming?,"Machine learning differs from traditional programming in several key ways:

**Traditional Programming:**
- Developers explicitly define every branch, loop, and conditional in the workflow upfront using deterministic logic and rules.
- The workflow is constructed as a graph consisting of nodes (representing steps or agents) and edges (representing handoffs), which must be pre-defined.
- This approach provides visual clarity but can become cumbersome and challenging as workflows grow more dynamic and complex, often requiring specialized domain-specific languages to manage the logic [1].

**Machine Learning:**
- Machine learning enables a more flexible, code-first approach where developers can directly express workflow logic using familiar programming constructs.
- Instead of pre-defining the entire logic, machine learning models learn patterns and decision-making from data, allowing for dynamic and adaptable orchestration.
- This approach is particularly beneficial for tasks where explicit rules are difficult to define, and adaptability is required as the workflow evolves [1].

**Key Points:**
- Traditional programming relies on explicit instructions and static logic.
- Machine learning leverages data-driven models to adapt and make decisions dynamically.
- Machine learning frameworks, such as the Agents SDK, allow developers to build workflows without needing to pre-define every possible scenario, making them suitable for complex and evolving tasks [1].

59,What are the main types of AI models?,"The main types of AI models are:

1. **Smaller, Faster Models:** These models are suitable for simple tasks such as retrieval or intent classification. They offer advantages in terms of lower latency and cost but may not perform as well on complex tasks.

2. **More Capable, Larger Models:** These models are ideal for complex tasks that require higher accuracy, such as making nuanced decisions (e.g., refund approvals). They generally have higher computational requirements and cost but provide better performance for challenging problems.

**Model Selection Principles:**
1. Set up evaluations to establish a performance baseline.
2. Focus on meeting your accuracy target using the best models available.
3. Optimize for cost and latency by replacing larger models with smaller ones where possible.

A practical approach is to start with the most capable model for every task to set a baseline, then experiment with smaller models to see if they maintain acceptable results, balancing performance, cost, and speed as needed [1].

60,What is the role of large language models (LLMs) in AI?,"Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role in AI by enabling advanced automation, decision-making, and interaction with external systems. Here are some key roles of LLMs in AI:

1. **Workflow Execution and Decision Making:** LLMs are central to agent systems, managing workflow execution and making decisions on behalf of users. They enable agents to recognize when a workflow is complete and can proactively correct actions or halt execution if needed, transferring control back to the user when necessary [1].

2. **Automation and Independence:** LLMs empower agents to perform tasks independently, distinguishing them from conventional software or simple chatbots that do not control workflow execution. This independence allows agents to handle complex, multi-step tasks reliably and consistently [1].

3. **Tool Interaction:** LLMs allow agents to access and interact with various external tools and systems, dynamically selecting the appropriate tools depending on the workflow’s current state. This capability ensures agents operate within defined guardrails and can gather context or take actions as needed [1].

4. **Handling Complexity and Ambiguity:** LLMs excel in managing workflows where traditional deterministic and rule-based approaches fall short, such as nuanced reasoning in payment fraud analysis. They evaluate context, consider subtle patterns, and identify suspicious activity even when clear-cut rules aren’t violated, making them effective in complex, ambiguous situations [1].

LLMs thus serve as the intelligence behind agents, enabling advanced automation, decision-making, and interaction with external systems in AI applications [1].

[1]: cite:1 ""Citation-1""",11.462465600008727,f6011423-adb0-4703-b90f-3c9d7aaa66c2,1696
61,How do AI agents reason through ambiguity?,"AI agents reason through ambiguity using several key strategies:

1. **Core Reasoning Component:** AI agents use large language models (LLMs) as their core reasoning engine. The LLM enables the agent to interpret ambiguous inputs, make decisions, and select appropriate actions based on context and available information [1].

2. **Structured Instructions:** Clear, structured instructions help guide the agent’s behavior, reducing ambiguity and improving decision-making. Explicit guidelines and guardrails define how the agent should respond to uncertain or incomplete information [1]​[2].

3. **Task Breakdown:** Agents are prompted to break down complex or ambiguous tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This approach minimizes confusion and helps the agent follow instructions more accurately [2].

4. **Edge Case Handling:** Robust routines anticipate common variations and edge cases, providing conditional steps or branches for the agent to follow when faced with unexpected or ambiguous scenarios [2].

5. **Human Intervention:** For high-risk or ambiguous situations where the agent’s confidence is low or the potential for error is high, guardrails such as human-in-the-loop intervention are triggered. This ensures safe and predictable operation, especially in production environments [3].

By combining capable models, well-defined tools, clear instructions, and escalation mechanisms, AI agents can effectively reason through ambiguity and deliver reliable outcomes in complex workflows [3]​[1]​[2].

62,What are the key challenges in deploying AI systems?,"The key challenges in deploying AI systems include:

1. **Ensuring Safe and Predictable Operation:** AI agents must operate safely and predictably, especially in production environments. This requires robust guardrails at every stage, including input filtering, tool use, and human-in-the-loop intervention to prevent undesirable outcomes and ensure reliability [1]​[2].

2. **Handling High-Risk Actions:** Certain actions, such as canceling user orders, authorizing large refunds, or making payments, are sensitive and carry high stakes. These should trigger human oversight until the agent’s reliability is well established to avoid irreversible or costly errors [2].

3. **Managing Failure Thresholds:** Setting limits on agent retries or actions is crucial. If an agent exceeds these limits (for example, failing to understand customer intent after multiple attempts), escalation to human intervention is necessary to maintain user experience and system integrity [2].

4. **Addressing Ambiguity and Complexity:** AI agents are designed to reason through ambiguity and handle multi-step tasks. Deploying them in workflows that involve complex decisions or unstructured data can be challenging, requiring careful orchestration and validation [1].

5. **Building Reliable Foundations:** Pairing capable models with well-defined tools and clear, structured instructions is essential. Starting with a single agent and evolving to multi-agent systems only when needed helps manage complexity and risk [1].

6. **Iterative Deployment and Validation:** Successful deployment is not an all-or-nothing process. It is important to start small, validate with real users, and gradually grow capabilities over time to uncover edge cases and improve performance iteratively [1].

In summary, deploying AI systems involves challenges related to safety, reliability, human oversight, handling high-risk actions, managing failure thresholds, and iterative validation. Implementing strong guardrails and planning for human intervention are critical to overcoming these challenges and ensuring successful deployment [1]​[2].

63,How can AI be used to automate workflows?,"AI can automate workflows by leveraging agents that use large language models (LLMs) to manage tasks end-to-end, make complex decisions, interact with external tools, and adapt dynamically to changing requirements. Here are some key points on how AI can be used to automate workflows:

1. **Core Capabilities:**
   - AI agents can independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users, managing workflow execution and making decisions using LLMs.
   - Unlike conventional software or simple chatbots, agents can recognize when a workflow is complete, proactively correct actions, halt execution in case of failure, and transfer control back to the user if needed.
   - Agents interact with various tools and external systems, dynamically selecting the appropriate tools depending on the workflow’s current state, always operating within clearly defined guardrails [1].

2. **Practical Applications:**
   - AI agents are well-suited for automating workflows that involve complex decisions, unstructured data, or where traditional rule-based systems are insufficient.
   - Example: In payment fraud analysis, an LLM agent can evaluate context and subtle patterns, identifying suspicious activity even when clear-cut rules aren’t violated, unlike a traditional rules engine that works like a checklist [1].

3. **Implementation Approach:**
   - Start with strong foundations: pair capable models with well-defined tools and clear, structured instructions.
   - Use orchestration patterns that match your complexity level, starting with a single agent and evolving to multi-agent systems as needed.
   - Guardrails are critical at every stage, from input filtering and tool use to human-in-the-loop intervention, ensuring agents operate safely and predictably in production.
   - Begin with small deployments, validate with real users, and iteratively grow capabilities over time [2].

4. **Technical Considerations:**
   - Declarative frameworks require developers to explicitly define every branch, loop, and conditional in the workflow upfront, which can become cumbersome as workflows grow more dynamic.
   - A code-first, non-declarative approach (such as the Agents SDK) allows developers to express workflow logic using familiar programming constructs, enabling more dynamic and adaptable agent orchestration without pre-defining the entire workflow graph [3].

In summary, AI can automate workflows by leveraging agents that use LLMs to manage tasks end-to-end, make complex decisions, interact with external tools, and adapt dynamically to changing requirements, all while maintaining safety and reliability through structured guardrails and human oversight [2]​[1]​[3].

64,What are the ethical considerations in AI deployment?,"The ethical considerations in AI deployment include:

1. **Human Intervention and Oversight**:
   - Human intervention acts as a critical safeguard to improve real-world performance and ensure user experience is not compromised.
   - Early deployment should include mechanisms for human oversight to identify failures, uncover edge cases, and establish robust evaluation cycles.
   - Agents should be able to gracefully transfer control to humans when unable to complete tasks, especially in sensitive scenarios such as customer service or coding.

2. **Guardrails and Safety Mechanisms**:
   - Implementing guardrails is essential for safe and predictable AI operation. These include:
     - Input filtering
     - Tool use restrictions
     - Human-in-the-loop intervention
   - Guardrails can be functions or agents enforcing policies like jailbreak prevention, relevance validation, keyword filtering, blocklist enforcement, and safety classification.

3. **Triggers for Human Oversight**:
   - Exceeding failure thresholds: If an agent fails to perform after multiple attempts, escalation to human intervention is necessary.
   - High-risk actions: Sensitive, irreversible, or high-stakes actions (e.g., canceling orders, authorizing large refunds, making payments) should always trigger human oversight until the agent’s reliability is proven.

4. **Iterative and Responsible Deployment**:
   - Start with small-scale deployments, validate with real users, and gradually expand capabilities.
   - Use orchestration patterns that match the complexity level, evolving from single-agent to multi-agent systems as needed.

5. **Transparency and Accountability**:
   - Ensure that the deployment process is transparent and that there are clear protocols for escalation and intervention.
   - Maintain accountability for decisions made by AI agents, especially in high-stakes or sensitive contexts.

These considerations help ensure that AI systems operate safely, predictably, and ethically, delivering real business value while protecting users and stakeholders [1]​[2].

123,What are the main types of AI models?,"The main types of AI models are:

1. **Smaller, Faster Models**: These models are suitable for simple tasks such as retrieval or intent classification. They offer advantages in terms of lower latency and cost but may not perform as well on complex tasks.
2. **More Capable, Larger Models**: These models are ideal for complex tasks that require higher accuracy, such as decision-making (e.g., approving a refund). They generally have higher computational requirements and cost but provide better performance for challenging problems.

**Model Selection Principles**:
1. Set up evaluations to establish a performance baseline.
2. Focus on meeting your accuracy target with the best models available.
3. Optimize for cost and latency by replacing larger models with smaller ones where possible.

A practical approach is to start with the most capable model for every task to set a baseline, then experiment with smaller models to see if they maintain acceptable results, balancing performance, cost, and latency as needed [1].

125,How do AI agents reason through ambiguity?,"AI agents reason through ambiguity by leveraging several core capabilities and design foundations:

1. **Core Reasoning Capabilities**:
   - **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: AI agents use LLMs to manage workflow execution and make decisions, allowing them to reason through ambiguous situations and complex tasks.
   - **Nuanced Reasoning**: Unlike traditional rule-based systems, which operate on deterministic checklists, agents use nuanced reasoning to evaluate context, consider subtle patterns, and identify issues even when clear-cut rules are not violated.
   - **Proactive Correction**: Agents can proactively correct their actions if needed, halt execution in case of failure, and transfer control back to the user, ensuring reliable and consistent task completion.

2. **Practical Example**:
   - **Payment Fraud Analysis**: In payment fraud analysis, a traditional rules engine flags transactions based on preset criteria. In contrast, an LLM-powered agent acts like a seasoned investigator, evaluating context and subtle patterns to identify suspicious activity, even when explicit rules are not triggered.

3. **Design Foundations**:
   - **Model**: The LLM that powers reasoning and decision-making.
   - **Tools**: External functions or APIs for taking action.
   - **Instructions**: Explicit guidelines and guardrails that define agent behavior.

4. **Guardrails and Human Intervention**:
   - To ensure safe and predictable operation, agents use guardrails at every stage, including input filtering, tool use, and human-in-the-loop intervention for high-risk or ambiguous actions.

In summary, AI agents reason through ambiguity by combining advanced LLM capabilities, access to external tools, and structured instructions, enabling them to handle complex, unstructured, or ambiguous workflows with a high degree of autonomy and adaptability [1]​[2]​[3].

126,What are the key challenges in deploying AI systems?,"The key challenges in deploying AI systems include:

1. **Ensuring Reliability and Safety**: AI agents must operate safely and predictably, especially in production environments. Guardrails are essential at every stage, including input filtering, tool use, and human-in-the-loop intervention, to prevent unsafe or unpredictable behavior [1]​[2].

2. **Handling Ambiguity and Complex Decisions**: AI systems often need to reason through ambiguity and make complex decisions, which can be difficult when dealing with unstructured data or brittle rule-based systems. Building strong foundations with capable models, well-defined tools, and clear instructions is crucial [1].

3. **Human Intervention and Oversight**: Human intervention is a critical safeguard, particularly early in deployment. It helps identify failures, uncover edge cases, and establish robust evaluation cycles. Mechanisms must be in place to escalate issues to human agents when the AI cannot complete a task or when high-risk actions are involved (e.g., canceling orders, authorizing refunds, making payments) [2].

4. **Managing Failure Thresholds**: Setting limits on agent retries or actions is necessary. If an agent exceeds these limits, such as failing to understand customer intent after multiple attempts, escalation to human intervention is required [2].

5. **Iterative Validation and Scaling**: Successful deployment is not all-or-nothing. Starting small, validating with real users, and gradually growing capabilities over time is recommended to ensure reliability and business value [1].

6. **Policy Enforcement and Safety Mechanisms**: Implementing guardrails such as jailbreak prevention, relevance validation, keyword filtering, blocklist enforcement, and safety classification helps enforce policies and prevent constraint violations [2].

Deploying AI systems involves challenges related to reliability, safety, handling complex decisions, ensuring human oversight, managing failure thresholds, and enforcing policies. An iterative approach with strong foundations and robust guardrails is essential for successful deployment and scaling [1]​[2].

1. **Identify Suitable Use Cases**: AI agents are best suited for workflows where traditional rule-based automation falls short, such as scenarios involving complex decisions, unstructured data, or ambiguous situations.

2. **Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Use LLMs to manage workflow execution, enabling nuanced reasoning and adaptability. LLMs can proactively correct their actions, recognize when a workflow is complete, and halt execution or transfer control back to the user in case of failure.

3. **Integrate Tools**: Provide AI agents with access to various tools for interacting with external systems. This allows dynamic selection of the appropriate tool based on the workflow’s state, ensuring the agent can gather context and take necessary actions.

4. **Implement Guardrails**: Ensure safe and predictable operation by setting up guardrails, including input filtering, tool use restrictions, and human-in-the-loop intervention for high-risk actions or failure thresholds.

5. **Iterative Deployment**: Start with a single agent and simple workflows, validate with real users, and gradually expand capabilities and complexity as confidence grows. This approach helps ensure reliability and business value.

6. **Approaches to Workflow Orchestration**:
   - **Declarative Frameworks**: Require explicit definition of every branch, loop, and conditional in the workflow, which can become cumbersome as complexity increases.
   - **Non-Declarative (Code-First) Frameworks**: Allow developers to express workflow logic using familiar programming constructs without pre-defining the entire workflow graph, enabling more dynamic and adaptable orchestration.

7. **Best Practices**:
   - Pair capable models with well-defined tools and clear, structured instructions.
   - Use orchestration patterns that match the complexity of your workflow.
   - Start small, validate, and scale up as needed to ensure reliability and business value.

By following these principles, AI agents can automate not just individual tasks but entire workflows, delivering intelligence and adaptability to business processes [1]​[2]​[3].

132,What is the function of external tools or APIs in agentic AI?,"### Function of External Tools or APIs in Agentic AI

1. **Action Enablement**:
   - External tools or APIs allow agents to take actions within systems, such as adding new information to databases, updating records, or sending messages. This extends the agent’s capabilities beyond reasoning and decision-making, enabling practical workflow execution.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - These tools help agents access necessary context and information, such as querying transaction databases, reading PDF documents, or searching the web, which is essential for informed decision-making.

3. **Orchestration**:
   - Agents can use other agents as tools, facilitating complex workflows where tasks are split across multiple agents. This is known as the Manager Pattern, where orchestration tools coordinate activities among agents.

4. **Interacting with Legacy Systems**:
   - For systems without APIs, agents may use computer-use models to interact directly with applications and web UIs, mimicking human actions to perform required tasks.

Well-documented and reusable tools improve discoverability, simplify version management, and prevent redundant definitions, making agent workflows more efficient and scalable [1].

133,How do explicit instructions and guardrails define agent behavior?,"### Defining Agent Behavior: Explicit Instructions and Guardrails

**Explicit Instructions**:
- These are clear guidelines and rules that specify how the agent should act and respond in various situations.
- Instructions serve as the foundational guardrails, ensuring the agent behaves in a predictable and controlled manner.
- For example, in agent design, instructions might define the agent’s purpose (e.g., “You are a helpful agent who can talk to users about the weather”) and set boundaries for its actions [1].

**Guardrails**:
- Guardrails are layered defense mechanisms that protect agent actions and ensure safety and compliance.
- They include:
  - **LLM-based guardrails**: Use the model’s reasoning to assess the relevance and safety of user inputs.
  - **Rules-based guardrails**: Implement specific rules such as regex filters, blacklists, and input character limits to block unsafe or irrelevant requests.
  - **Moderation APIs**: External services (like the OpenAI Moderation API) that vet user inputs for safety.
- Guardrails work together to filter inputs, prevent unsafe actions, and escalate high-risk or ambiguous situations to human intervention if necessary [2]​[3].

**Summary**:
- Explicit instructions set the agent’s behavioral boundaries and purpose.
- Guardrails enforce these boundaries, filter unsafe inputs, and ensure the agent operates safely and predictably, often escalating to human oversight for high-risk actions [1]​[2]​[3].

134,What orchestration patterns are used in agentic AI?,"### Orchestration Patterns in Agentic AI

**1. Single-Agent Systems**:
- **Structure**: A single model (agent) equipped with tools and instructions to execute workflows in a loop.
- **Capabilities**: The agent can incrementally add tools to expand its capabilities, keeping complexity manageable and simplifying evaluation and maintenance.
- **Operation**: The system operates with a run loop, continuing until an exit condition is met (such as a tool call, structured output, error, or maximum number of turns).
- **Enhancements**: Internal components like instructions, tools, guardrails, and hooks can be added to enhance functionality [1].

**2. Multi-Agent Systems**:
- **Structure**: Workflow execution is distributed across multiple coordinated agents.
- **Categories**:
  - **Manager Pattern (Agents as Tools)**: A central “manager” agent coordinates multiple specialized agents via tool calls, each handling a specific task or domain.
  - **Decentralized Pattern (Agents Handing Off to Agents)**: Multiple agents operate as peers, handing off tasks to one another based on their specializations.
- **Modeling**: Multi-agent systems can be modeled as graphs, with agents as nodes and edges representing either tool calls (manager pattern) or handoffs (decentralized pattern).

135,When should you use a single agent versus a multi-agent system?,"### Choosing Between Single-Agent and Multi-Agent Systems in Agentic AI

**Single-Agent Systems**:
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for keeping complexity manageable and simplifying evaluation and maintenance.
- **Capabilities**: A single agent can incrementally add tools to expand its capabilities, avoiding premature orchestration of multiple agents.
- **Workflow**: Suitable for workflows that can be executed in a loop by one model equipped with appropriate tools and instructions.
- **Recommendation**: Start with a single-agent system and consider multi-agent orchestration as requirements grow and become more complex [1].

**Multi-Agent Systems**:
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for scenarios where workflow execution needs to be distributed across multiple coordinated agents.
- **Capabilities**: Efficient for handling tasks that are too complex or diverse for a single agent.
- **Workflow**: Allows for a sequence of tool calls and handoffs between agents, enabling the model to run multiple steps until an exit condition is met [2].

**Recommended Approach**:
- **Incremental Development**: Begin with a single-agent system for manageable complexity.
- **Transition**: Move to a multi-agent system when the workflow demands distributed execution and coordination among agents.

136,What are the benefits of agentic AI in handling unstructured data?,"### Benefits of Agentic AI in Handling Unstructured Data

1. **Automated Interpretation of Natural Language**:
   - Agentic AI can process and understand natural language, making it effective for tasks such as extracting meaning from documents or interacting with users conversationally. This is particularly valuable in scenarios like processing home insurance claims, where information is often presented in varied and unstructured formats.

2. **Enhanced Workflow Automation**:
   - By leveraging agentic AI, organizations can automate workflows that previously resisted automation due to the complexity and variability of unstructured data. This leads to increased efficiency and reduced manual intervention.

3. **Context-Sensitive Decision Making**:
   - Agentic AI systems are capable of nuanced judgment and handling exceptions, which is essential when dealing with unstructured data that may not fit rigid rule-based systems.

4. **Scalability and Adaptability**:
   - These agents can adapt to new data formats and requirements over time, allowing businesses to scale their automation efforts without extensive reprogramming or rule updates.

5. **Reduction in Error-Prone Manual Processes**:
   - Automating the interpretation and processing of unstructured data minimizes human errors and ensures more consistent outcomes across workflows.

Agentic AI is especially beneficial in domains where traditional automation struggles with the variability and ambiguity inherent in unstructured data, providing intelligent and adaptable solutions for complex business needs [1].

137,How do agents execute multi-step tasks autonomously?,"### Agent Autonomy in Multi-Step Task Execution

**1. Workflow Automation and Reasoning**:
- Agents are designed to reason through ambiguity, take action across various tools, and handle multi-step tasks with a high degree of autonomy. This makes them suitable for complex decisions and unstructured data, going beyond simple rule-based systems [1].

**2. Orchestration Patterns**:
- There are two main orchestration patterns:
  - **Single-agent systems**: A single model equipped with tools and instructions executes workflows in a loop.
  - **Multi-agent systems**: Workflow execution is distributed across multiple coordinated agents, allowing for more complex and scalable task management [2].

**3. Execution Flow**:
- In the Agents SDK, agents operate in a loop, processing tasks until an exit condition is met:
  - **Exit Condition 1**: A final-output tool is invoked, producing a specific output type.
  - **Exit Condition 2**: The model returns a response without any tool calls, such as a direct user message.
- Multi-agent systems allow for sequences of tool calls and handoffs between agents, enabling the model to run multiple steps until an exit condition is reached [3].

**4. Managing Complexity**:
- Prompt templates and policy variables are used to adapt workflows for different contexts, simplifying maintenance and evaluation. This approach allows agents to update variables for new use cases without rewriting entire workflows [3].

**5. Guardrails and Human Intervention**:
- Guardrails, including input filtering and human-in-the-loop intervention, are critical for ensuring agents operate safely and predictably. High-risk actions and failure thresholds can trigger escalation to human oversight, maintaining reliability in autonomous execution [1].

**Summary**:
Agents autonomously execute multi-step tasks by reasoning through complex workflows, using orchestration patterns (single or multi-agent), looping through tasks until exit conditions are met, and employing guardrails for safety and reliability. This enables them to automate entire workflows with intelligence and adaptability [1]​[2]​[3].

138,What is the process for instantiating an agent using an SDK?,"### Process for Instantiating an Agent Using an SDK

**Core Components Required**:
- **Model**: The LLM that powers the agent’s reasoning and decision-making.
- **Tools**: External functions or APIs the agent can use to take action.
- **Instructions**: Explicit guidelines and guardrails defining how the agent behaves [1].

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:

1. **Define the Agent’s Model**
   - Select the LLM that will be used for reasoning and decision-making.

2. **Specify Tools**
   - List the external functions or APIs the agent will use to perform actions.

3. **Set Instructions**
   - Write clear guidelines and guardrails for the agent’s behavior.

4. **Instantiate the Agent in Code**
   - Use the SDK to create an agent object, providing the name, instructions, and tools.
   - Example in Python using OpenAI’s Agents SDK:
     ```python
     weather_agent = Agent(
         name=""Weather agent"",
         instructions=""You are a helpful agent who can talk to users about the weather."",
         tools=[get_weather],
     )
     ```
   - This code block demonstrates how to instantiate an agent by specifying its name, instructions, and available tools [1].

**Summary Table of Components**:
- **Model**: LLM for reasoning
- **Tools**: APIs/functions for actions
- **Instructions**: Behavioral guidelines

This process ensures the agent is properly set up with all necessary components for effective operation using the SDK [1].

139,How do agents interact with users in real-world scenarios?,"### Agent Interaction with Users in Real-World Scenarios

**1. Clear Instructions and Task Breakdown**:
- Agents rely on high-quality, clear instructions to minimize ambiguity and improve decision-making.
- Tasks are broken down into smaller, actionable steps, making it easier for agents to follow and execute routines effectively.

**2. Defined Actions**:
- Each step in an agent’s routine corresponds to a specific action or output, such as asking for user information or calling an API.
- Explicit instructions for user-facing messages help reduce errors in interpretation.

**3. Handling Edge Cases**:
- Agents are designed to anticipate common variations in user interactions, such as incomplete information or unexpected questions.
- Conditional steps or branches are included to handle these edge cases, ensuring robust and flexible workflows.

**4. Layered Guardrails for Input Moderation**:
- User inputs are vetted using multiple layers of guardrails, including:
  - LLM-based guardrails for relevance and safety.
  - Rules-based guardrails such as regex, blacklist, and input character limits.
  - Moderation APIs to classify inputs as safe or unsafe.
- Unsafe inputs trigger responses like “we cannot process your message. Try again!” while safe inputs proceed to function calls or further agent actions.

**5. Human Intervention Mechanism**:
- Agents are equipped with mechanisms to escalate issues to human agents when they cannot complete a task or when high-risk actions are involved.
- Triggers for human intervention include exceeding failure thresholds (e.g., repeated misunderstanding of user intent) and actions that are sensitive or irreversible (e.g., authorizing large refunds).

**6. Workflow Execution**:
- Agents execute workflows smoothly by following structured routines, handling edge cases, and escalating to humans when necessary, ensuring a reliable and user-friendly experience in customer service and other domains [1]​[2]​[3].
