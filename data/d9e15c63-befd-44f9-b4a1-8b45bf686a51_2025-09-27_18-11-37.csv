20,What was the Mountbatten Plan?,"The Mountbatten Plan, also known as the 3rd June Plan, was a significant proposal announced on June 3, 1947, by Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India. Its main objective was to address the growing demand for independence and resolve communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in British India. The plan accepted the principle of partition, leading to the creation of two separate nations: India and Pakistan. It granted dominion status to both successor governments within the British Commonwealth.

Key points of the Mountbatten Plan include:

- Partitioning the provinces of Punjab and Bengal into Muslim-majority and Hindu-majority areas, with a boundary commission established to demarcate the borders.
- Recognizing the sovereignty and autonomy of both India and Pakistan, allowing them to create their own constitutions.
- Giving princely states the option to join either India or Pakistan or remain independent.
- Allowing the people of the North West Frontier Province to decide their future through a referendum.
- Facilitating the speedy transfer of power from British rule to the newly formed nations and providing a framework for their independence and integration of princely states.

The strategy was approved by both the Congress and the Muslim League and was implemented through the Indian Independence Act 1947, which received royal assent on July 18, 1947 [1]​[2]​[3].
