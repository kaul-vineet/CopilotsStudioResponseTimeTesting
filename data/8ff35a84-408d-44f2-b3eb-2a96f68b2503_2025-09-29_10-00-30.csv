3,What are the ethical considerations in AI deployment?,"**Ethical Considerations in AI Deployment**

1. **Human Intervention and Oversight**
   - Human intervention acts as a critical safeguard in AI agent deployment, especially in high-risk scenarios or when failure thresholds are exceeded.
   - For example, in customer service, unresolved issues should be escalated to a human agent.
   - In coding or automation, control should revert to the user if the agent cannot complete a task.
   - High-risk actions such as canceling orders, authorizing large refunds, or making payments require human oversight until the agent’s reliability is proven [1].

2. **Guardrails and Safety Mechanisms**
   - Implementing guardrails is essential to ensure agents operate safely and predictably.
   - Guardrails can include input filtering, tool use restrictions, jailbreak prevention, relevance validation, keyword filtering, blocklist enforcement, and safety classification.
   - These mechanisms help prevent constraint violations and ensure ethical operation [1].

3. **Gradual Deployment and Validation**
   - Start with small-scale deployments and validate with real users to identify failures and edge cases.
   - Iterative improvement and robust evaluation cycles are necessary to build reliable and ethical AI systems [2].

4. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - Clearly define policies and escalation triggers for human intervention.
   - Maintain transparency in decision-making processes and ensure accountability for actions taken by AI agents [1].

5. **Risk Management**
   - Sensitive, irreversible, or high-stakes actions should always be subject to human review.
   - Set limits on agent retries or actions to avoid unintended consequences and escalate when necessary [1].

**Summary**
Ethical AI deployment requires a combination of human oversight, robust guardrails, gradual validation, transparency, and risk management to ensure safe, reliable, and responsible operation in real-world scenarios [2]​[1].

7,What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and how does it work?,"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is a core component of the MCP architecture, designed for AI applications using a client-server structure. It acts as the backend that processes requests from AI clients and connects to resources like local filesystems, databases, or web APIs. The architecture includes three main roles: Host (user-facing AI app), Client (intermediary), and Server (MCP server). The Host initiates connections, user input flows through the Client to the Server, which processes requests and interacts with resources as needed. The MCP server can be started via command line and connected to AI IDEs like Cursor, offering tools such as web search or vector database search, and enabling agentic behavior by selecting the appropriate tool based on the query type [1]​[2]​[3].
