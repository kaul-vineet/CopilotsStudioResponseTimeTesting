1,How can I run an agent to interact with a SQLite MCP server?,"To run an agent to interact with a SQLite MCP server, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Environment**: Ensure you have a SQLite MCP server set up with tools like `add_data` and `read_data` for database operations.

2. **Start the Agent Loop**: Use Python to run an agent in a loop, allowing user interaction. The basic code structure involves continuously prompting the user for input, breaking the loop if the user enters 'exit', printing the user's input, passing the input to a handler function that processes the message and interacts with the agent and context, and printing the agent's response. Example code:
```python
while True:
    user_input = input(""Enter your message: "")
    if user_input == ""exit"":
        break
    print(""User: "", user_input)
    response = await handle_user_message(user_input, agent, agent_context, verbose=True)
    print(""Agent: "", response)
```
This loop enables the agent to process commands and interact with the SQLite MCP server.

3. **Interact with the Database**: To add data, use a command like `Add to the db: Rafael Nadal whose age is 39 and is a tennis player`. The agent will call the `add_data` tool with the appropriate SQL query. To fetch data, use a command like `Fetch data`. The agent will call the `read_data` tool and return the results from the database.

4. **Access Source Code and Resources**: The source code for building a 100% local MCP client is available via a QR code or hyperlink provided in the documentation.

Summary of Workflow: User submits a query, agent connects to the MCP server to discover and invoke tools, agent processes the query, interacts with the database, and returns a context-aware response.

Tech Stack Used: LlamaIndex for building the MCP-powered agent, Ollama to locally serve Deepseek-R1 as the LLM, LightningAI for development and hosting, SQLite for the database.

2,What are the benefits of using MCP for financial analysis?,"The benefits of using MCP (Model Context Protocol) for financial analysis include:

1. **Automated and Efficient Workflow**: MCP enables the creation of AI agents that can fetch, analyze, and generate insights on stock market trends automatically, streamlining the financial analysis process and reducing manual effort [1].

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: The system leverages CrewAI for orchestrating multiple specialized agents, such as query parsers, code writers, and code executors, ensuring that each step of the analysis is handled by an expert agent for improved accuracy and efficiency [1]​[2].

3. **Local and Secure Execution**: By using tools like Ollama to serve models locally and integrating with platforms like Cursor or Claude Desktop, MCP allows financial analysis to be performed securely on local infrastructure, minimizing data exposure risks [1].

4. **Customizable and Extensible Tech Stack**: MCP supports integration with various tools and technologies, such as FastAPI for server implementation and Python for code execution, making it highly customizable for different financial analysis needs [2].

5. **Enhanced User Experience**: Additional tools like `save_code` and `run_code_and_show_plot` allow users to save generated analysis scripts and visualize results directly, improving usability and accessibility for analysts [2].

6. **Visual Insights**: The workflow culminates in the generation of analysis plots, such as comparative stock returns, providing clear and actionable visual insights for decision-making [1]​[2].

7. **Modular Architecture**: MCP’s modular design allows for easy setup and integration of new agents and tools, facilitating scalability and adaptability to evolving financial analysis requirements [1]​[2].

3,How do I troubleshoot issues with MCP server integration in Cursor?,"To troubleshoot MCP server integration issues in Cursor, follow these steps:

1. **Verify MCP Server Configuration in Cursor**: Ensure the MCP server is added as a global server in Cursor settings and check the JSON configuration file for correct syntax and required fields.

2. **Check Server Status in Cursor**: Verify the server status in Cursor settings. If the server is not running, review the command and arguments used to launch the server and ensure required environment variables are set.

3. **Validate Server Path and URL**: Double-check the server path or URL entered in the configuration to ensure it is correct and accessible.

4. **Review Integration with Other Tools**: Ensure the configuration file for tools like Claude includes the correct server path, arguments, and environment variables.

5. **Confirm Code and Server Launch**: Verify that the server code is correct and runs without errors. Ensure the server is started and listening on the expected transport or port.

6. **Additional Checks**: Ensure Cursor IDE and MCP server are running compatible versions, restart Cursor and the MCP server after making configuration changes, and use provided reference code and setup guides.

Common challenges include incorrect server path or command, missing environment variables, server not running, and integration with external tools failing. Validate all endpoints, tokens, and arguments in the configuration files.

8,What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and how does it work?,"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is a standardized interface and framework that enables AI models to interact seamlessly with external tools, resources, and environments. It operates within a client-server architecture tailored for AI contexts, with three main roles:

1. **Host**: The user-facing AI application.
2. **Client**: Acts as an intermediary.
3. **Server**: Executes tasks by connecting to resources.

The MCP server can be integrated with applications like Cursor, providing tools such as a web search tool and a vector database search tool. Depending on the query type, the MCP server invokes the appropriate tool, demonstrating agentic behavior. The architecture is typically illustrated with Hosts at the top, Clients in the middle, Servers below, and underlying resources at the bottom, showing the flow of information and tasks through the system [1]​[2]​[3].
