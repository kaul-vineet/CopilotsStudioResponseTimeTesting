7,What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and how does it work?,"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is a framework designed to facilitate the integration and execution of various tools and resources within a unified environment. It works by providing a structured architecture that allows for the seamless interaction between different components, enabling efficient workflows and data processing.

Key aspects of the MCP server include:

1. **Architecture**: The MCP server is built on a modular architecture that supports the integration of various tools and resources. This allows for flexibility and scalability in handling different tasks and workflows.

2. **Workflow**: The server manages the execution of tasks by coordinating the interaction between different tools and resources. This ensures that tasks are completed efficiently and accurately.

3. **Starting the Server**: The MCP server can be started using specific commands and configurations. Once started, it is ready to handle incoming requests and execute tasks.

4. **Connecting to Cursor IDE**: The MCP server can be connected to the Cursor Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to facilitate the development and execution of tasks. This integration allows for a streamlined workflow and improved productivity.

5. **Resources and Tools**: The MCP server provides access to a wide range of resources and tools, enabling users to perform various tasks such as data analysis, processing, and visualization.

6. **Practical Examples**: The server can be used in various practical scenarios, such as financial analysis, data processing, and automation of workflows.

7. **Challenges**: While the MCP server offers numerous benefits, it may also present challenges such as configuration complexities, integration issues, and the need for ongoing maintenance and updates.

9,What are the main components of MCP architecture?,"The main components of MCP architecture include:

1. **Host**: The user-facing AI application where the AI model interacts with the user. Examples include chat applications, AI-enhanced IDEs, or custom apps with embedded AI assistants. The Host initiates connections to MCP servers, captures user input, maintains conversation history, and displays model replies.
2. **Client**: Acts as an intermediary between the Host and the Server. Each Host application can have one or more MCP Clients that handle communication and requests.
3. **Server**: The backend component that processes requests from the Client. MCP Servers connect to various resources such as local filesystems, databases, or web APIs to fulfill the AI application's needs.
4. **Underlying Resources**: These are the actual data sources or tools that MCP Servers interact with, such as local filesystems, databases, and web APIs.

The architecture follows a client-server model, with a clear flow from Host applications to Clients, then to Servers, and finally to the underlying resources. The system is designed to standardize and simplify integration between AI applications and external tools, making it scalable and efficient for developers and tool providers [1]​[2]​[3].

13,What is the JSON configuration needed for integrating a financial analyst MCP server?,"To integrate a financial analyst MCP server, you need to set up the appropriate tech stack, configure the server in Cursor with a JSON file, implement the required tools for analysis, code saving, and plot generation, and ensure the server is live and connected for real-time financial analysis tasks. The JSON configuration file should have the following structure:

```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""financialanalyst"": {
      ""command"": ""uvicorn"",
      ""args"": [
        ""-directory"",
        ""absolute/path/to/project_root"",
        ""run"",
        ""server.py""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The server name (e.g., ""financialanalyst"") and the server path (e.g., ""absolute/path/to/project_root/server.py"") must be specified. The MCP server is implemented using FastAPI and includes tools such as daily stock analysis, save code, run code, and show plot. The server should be able to save code, execute it, and display the resulting plot, such as comparing Tesla vs Nvidia stock returns. After integration, the Cursor Settings interface should display the financial analyst MCP server as active and connected. The server should be live and able to process queries, generate code, and return analysis plots [1]​[2]​[3].
